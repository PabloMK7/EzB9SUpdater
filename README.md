# EzB9SUpdater - Easy Boot9Strap Updater
A 3DS tool to update B9S to the latest version (currently v1.4) without the need of external tools.

# Building
Building CTGP-7 Launcher is handled through buildtools. You have to have the following installed:
- [devkitPro with devkitARM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/)
- ctrulib (installed automatically with the devkitARM script)
- [citro3d](https://github.com/fincs/citro3d)
- [portlibs](https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds_portlibs)

Once you have installed all the dependencies simply run `make` and if you set it all up correctly it should build.
